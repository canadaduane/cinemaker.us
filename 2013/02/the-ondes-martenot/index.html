<p>I’ve been racking my brains for the past couple of weeks trying to figure out a way to make a &#8220;sliding potentiometer&#8221; the full length of the cinemaker pocket dolly. Today, after one lucky email exchange, I have a cost effective solution that sounds like music to my ears.</p>

<p>In frustration with my expensive or otherwise difficult-to-implement ideas, I sent the following email to my friends back in the Chicago hackerspace (PS1):</p>

<blockquote><p>I want to be able to measure the distance from one end of an aluminum extrusion to two (variable) points along the length of the extrusion. e.g.</p></blockquote>

<pre>
|====================aluminum======================| 1 meter  
sensor>           [knob]            [knob]
</pre>


<blockquote><p>Basically, I want to recreate the functionality of a double &#8220;slide potentiometer&#8221; but the slide is 1m long. Each of the &#8220;[knob]&#8221; things in the above blueprint is a knob that can slide the entire length of the aluminum extrusion.</p>

<p>I’ve considered many options for the sensor. Some measure relative distance (e.g. an optical mouse sensor that reads &#8220;tick&#8221; marks along the bottom, or a &#8220;spring-loaded&#8221; coil of string with a rotary encoder on the coil) and some measure absolute distance (e.g. an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, or a video camera). After giving it some thought, I think only the absolute distance measurements will work in this case, since I can’t know where the starting location of the knobs when the system is powered on.</p>

<p>The cheapest method seems to be ultrasonic sensors (see <a href="/images/2013-02/ondes-martenot.jpg">1</a>), however I don’t want wires dangling. One way to avoid power and wires to the knobs is if I mount one tranceiver on the end of the aluminum extrusion (as pictured above). However, then the problem is that the sensor detects the BAR ITSELF and says &#8220;hey something is really close&#8221;. I could get around this by mounting 2 more ultrasonic tranceivers–one at each of the sliding knobs I want to measure. In this scenario, instead of sending and receiving the ultrasonic pulse from the same location, I could break it up and send at the knob and receive at the end of the aluminum extrusion. If I take this course, however, it means I must send power through wires to ultrasonic transmitters at the knobs.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t want wires hanging about. So I was thinking, as a software engineer is generally wont to do, about computer vision. I could hypothetically mount a camera at one end of the slider (as pictured) and then look for &#8220;hot pink&#8221; colored knobs. Divide the inverse ratio of non-hot-pink pixels to hot-pink pixels and I would get the absolute<br/>
distance to the hot pink knobs. This method could work since &#8220;hot pink&#8221; is not generally found in natural environments (except for my 3 year old daughter’s birthday party…) </p>

<p>The problem with the above solution is that video cameras are a little more expensive than ultrasonic sensors, and much more computationally intensive. So that got me thinking. What if I could coat the knobs with a material that is the &#8220;sonic equivalent&#8221; of hot pink? Does such a thing exist? Is there a way to detect echoes from various surfaces such that the receiver will ignore certain types of (non-hot-pink) sounds?</p>

<p>I know it’s kind of a crazy analogy, but since I’ve hit a wall with ideas I thought I’d ask for your thoughts. If anyone has any ideas I’d love to hear them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mason replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dare I ask why you wouldn’t use something like what an Ondes Martinot http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondes_Martenot uses? It seems pretty darn close to &#8220;slide potentiometer&#8221; in actual function, with the length you desire.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The Ondes Martenot? What the heck is that?&#8221; I thought. It turns out that there’s a beautiful instrument invented in the early 20th century that uses a &#8220;ring&#8221; (the kind of ring you put your finger in) to slide along the length of a keyboard/piano. The position of the ring indicates the pitch of the musical sound. If you’ve ever heard 1950s style &#8220;eerie martian music&#8221; it was probably an Ondes Martenot.</p>

<p>Shocked and amazed, I went to the wikipedia page to try to figure out how it works. Unfortunately, the technical details were scant. So I turned to google and sure enough, someone has re-created the Ondes Martenot and revealed its secret! Dana Countryman gave this demonstration of his DIY instrument:</p>

<p>So the take-away for me is this: keep the creative ideas flowing, but don’t hesitate to go to a group of knowledgeable people with a seemingly intractable problem–they are bound to drop an OMG why didn’t I think of that? bomb and make life simpler.</p>
