<p>Technically, the first version of the Maker Slider was called the Weave Slider, and I posted about it on MakerHome.ca <a href="/images/2012-10-00-makerslider-0.2.png" title="MakerSlider 0.2">1</a>. I didn’t release any files at the time–there weren’t any to release!–and so this time it’s a lot more satisfying to be able to release some STL files and OpenSCAD files that you can download or modify.</p>

<p>All of the files are <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33368">available on Thingiverse</a>, and will probably be updated periodically once I have my workflow set straight.</p>

<p>For the tripod mounts (both on the base of the camera and on the bottom of the slider) I’ve chosen a small and fairly cheap tripod. Adam Sanders loaned me his base plate so I could create the specs. I anticipate that we will need to create several “base plate” compatible versions of the Maker Slider in order to accommodate various DSLR cameras as well as consumer cameras. I think what we have is a good place to start, but it isn’t enough either. We’ll develop the hardware as needed.</p>
