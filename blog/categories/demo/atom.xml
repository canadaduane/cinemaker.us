    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is pretty close to version 1.0 of the 1-axis Motorized MakerSlider Camera Slider (see <a href="http://makerslider.com/wp/roadmap/">the roadmap</a>). Notably absent is the user interface mounted to the slider itself. With that caveat out of the way, however, behold the MakerSlider nearing version 1.0! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent interview with University of Utah’s Fernando Rubio was published today by the company where I work. It uses the MakerSlider 0.3 (manual, no motor) to take 3 sliding shots throughout the video:</p>

<p>MakerSlider is in use at 1:07, 1:18, and 1:50 (probably the best shot). Note that these shots were taken while the Manfrotto Jr. ball head was in a wobbly off-center position, and the first iteration of the tripod mounts both broke while shooting! The shots turned out really well in spite of this, however. At this point in the development of the MakerSlider, I attribute that primarily to my coworker’s fine post production skills :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to my coworker and videographer friend, Adam Sanders, I have a new “first person perspective” video to post here. This one is of our coworker waving wildly and in an animated way to give us something interesting to look at as we slide away :)</p>

<p>We’re using the basic slider in this case, without the aluminum post that is a feature of v.0.2. I’m considering removing the post entirely, and replacing it with a tripod ball head such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-701HDV-Fluid-Video-Mini/dp/B001AT314M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352782213&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=tripod">this</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-391RC2-Junior-Head-Replaces/dp/B001TK3ELC/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352782213&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=tripod">this</a>.</p>
