While I’ll use the [Thingiverse page][1] as a once-in-a-while release area, I’ll be making most updates to the following github page:

 [1]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33368

https://github.com/canadaduane/MakerSlider

For example, I’ve updated the endcaps to actually have ends now (gasp!) and this sort of thing isn’t worthy of a release, so I’ve just updated the files on github.
