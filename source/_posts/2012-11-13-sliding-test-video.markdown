Thanks to my coworker and videographer friend, Adam Sanders, I have a new “first person perspective” video to post here. This one is of our coworker waving wildly and in an animated way to give us something interesting to look at as we slide away ![:)][1]

We’re using the basic slider in this case, without the aluminum post that is a feature of v.0.2. I’m considering removing the post entirely, and replacing it with a tripod ball head such as [this][2] or [this][3].
