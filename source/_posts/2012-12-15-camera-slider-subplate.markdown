I’ve been working on a 3D-printable version of the subplate that Bart Dring originally spec’ed in his [wiki page about the camera slider][1]. To my knowledge, he never released the specs for the subplate. Even if he did, I don’t have a laser cutter (well, I don’t have a **complete** and **fully functional** laser cutter). As a result, I’m remaking the parts in 3D form so that they can be printed. Here are some shots of the progress today.

**Update:** The subplate has been improved and the source is available [here][4].
