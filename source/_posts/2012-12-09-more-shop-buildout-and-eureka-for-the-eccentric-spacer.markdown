This week i’ve been building out more of the shop–I’m excited to have an actual bench lining the far wall of the “fablab” / makerspace. Along the way, I’ve also been working on the slider’s carriage and ball head mounting.

The MakerSlide has a lot of optional parts that you can buy from Inventables, and to be honest I didn’t understand what they were all used at first. For example, I saw the “[precision shim washer][1]” available and didn’t buy it on my first run. It soon became obvious why it is needed, however–if you put the two ball bearings into the [v-wheel][2] without the washer in between and then tighten, well, the ball bearings pick up a lot of friction along the way (the bolt squeezes and applies pressure orthogonal to the way the bearing is meant to have pressure applied, so it really isn’t the bearing’s fault!)

Another example of a part that isn’t obvious–the [eccentric spacer][3] [1]. The [aluminum carriage plate][4] has many holes in it and so I thought it would be easy to find a few holes that fit the [aluminum extrusion][5] just right. Unfortunately, while it’s possible to find holes that are **really close** to the right spot, they are almost always just a little too tight. Consequently, the carriage is too stiff and you can feel bumps along the way because the imperfections of the bearings are magnified as they roll.
