The Cinemaker Cinemon Stick has undergone a number of naming iterations over the past 8 months as we've built it out and experimented with ideas. We started the project as the "Makerslider Camera Slider" and iterated on "Pocket Dolly" as an alternative name (and also to avoid stepping on Cineslider Camera Slider's toes).

As we approach the 2.0 design, we're changing the name to the Cinemon Stick&mdash;aka the Cinemaker Cinemon Stick. It sounds fun, has enough distinctiveness as to be searchable, and incorporates the "cinema" prefix that we'd hoped for.

And to accompany the name change, we're moving the website from makerslider.com to cinemaker.com! Please bear with me (Duane) as I update things and make the new site as information-rich as the old.
