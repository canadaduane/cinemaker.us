So after I picked up a Manfrotto Jr. ball head to be mounted on the slider carriage, I quickly discovered that the best way to mount it to the aluminum carriage would be to bolt it on directly—the [Manfrotto Jr. Head][1] comes with a 5/8″ threaded hole on the bottom.

But with a new, barebones shop comes limitations (and powers! don’t forget the super powers!). Until today the limitation that pressed most urgently was “no drill press”. It’s amazing how easy it is to do things with the right tool! Pictured below is the first 5/8″ hole that I drilled into the [standard aluminum plate][2] that can be purchased with makerslide. The other holes that are machined into the standard plate are 3/8″ and 1/4″—too small for the Manfrotto threading, unfortunately.

The green area on the surface near the hole is some bike chain oil that I’m using to ease the bit through the aluminum. I’m sure there’s something better to use out there, but it’s what I had on hand ![:)][3]
