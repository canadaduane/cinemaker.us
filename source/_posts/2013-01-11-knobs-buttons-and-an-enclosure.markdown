Just before I shipped the first MakerSlider off to its (first!) owner, I built this enclosure for the 2 buttons and a knob:

The basic UI is simple: turn the knob to adjust speed, and then press a button (either “left” or “right”) to make the slider move left or right until it reaches the end. You can press a button again to (abruptly) stop the slider movement.
