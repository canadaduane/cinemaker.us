I’ve begun work on the next prototype version of the motorized pocket dolly (Tentatively called the Cinemaker Pocket Dolly). The [plans are up on Thingiverse][1] (new project) as well as [github][2] (same old project).

The major design change for this pocket dolly is the side-mounted motor. As I’ve mentioned previously, no longer will the slider have a motor and its wires move with the “sled” in the middle. Instead, the power will be transferred through a full loop timing belt connected to the sled. It leaves a lot more room for better design decisions and I think it’s safer for the camera as well (nothing to trip over).

I’ve been experimenting with some new 5 kg-cm holding torque motors that also sport a “D” shaft. These will be much stronger and slip less than the original design. I’m excited to be able to enable Epic users (with their minimum 5lb video camera) to pan and slide. No promises yet, but at this stage I think it will be possible.
