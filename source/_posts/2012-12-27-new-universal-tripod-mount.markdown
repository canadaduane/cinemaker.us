Today I finished designing and 3D printing a “new and improved” universal tripod mount for makerslide. Previous attempts to build a tripod mount were either too weak, or not flat on the bottom (i.e. bolt heads protruded, making the surface not flat). I’m pretty happy with this latest design.

In order to make it stronger, I used a flanged 1/4"-20 nut. The flange part of the nut has a firm grip and is set deeply in the plastic part that mounts to the makerslide. In addition, there are 4 holes for bolts that connect to the makerslide to help balance the strain of a slider being twisted or pulled under the weight of a camera (or manual setup of the slider, for that matter–my coworker unintentionally broke two of the previous version of the universal tripod mount, simply by attaching and reattaching the slider to tripods).
