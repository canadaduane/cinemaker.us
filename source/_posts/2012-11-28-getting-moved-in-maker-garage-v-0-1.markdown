So my wife and I have finally completed our move to Salt Lake City, Utah from Chicago, Illinois. We’re super excited to be here and to finally set roots down and own a house! The bad news is that it has taken a couple of weeks out of my intended MakerSlider building time. The good news is that I’m all set up and ready to keep things rolling. By “all set up” I mean I have a table in my garage for the MakerSlider project, and my Ultimaker set up on a bench. See photos :)
