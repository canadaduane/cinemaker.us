A recent interview with University of Utah’s Fernando Rubio was published today by the company where I work. It uses the MakerSlider 0.3 (manual, no motor) to take 3 sliding shots throughout the video:

MakerSlider is in use at 1:07, 1:18, and 1:50 (probably the best shot). Note that these shots were taken while the Manfrotto Jr. ball head was in a wobbly off-center position, and the first iteration of the tripod mounts both broke while shooting! The shots turned out really well in spite of this, however. At this point in the development of the MakerSlider, I attribute that primarily to my coworker’s fine post production skills ![:)][2]
