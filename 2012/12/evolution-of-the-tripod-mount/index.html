	<h2 class="title">Evolution of the Tripod Mount</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I thought it would be fun to see all of my failed attempts to create a tripod mount together in one shot. There were 4 unsatisfactory versions of the “universal tripod mount” before settling on the current design.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vc8y4vmuy3nit49/2012-12-27-tripod-mount-evolution.jpg?dl=1"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vc8y4vmuy3nit49/2012-12-27-tripod-mount-evolution.jpg?dl=1" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Each of the earlier designs has a flaw that made me have to scratch it and start over.</p>

<p>When I designed the first version, I had only one tripod to mount the slider to. I didn’t realize at this point that tripod base plates come in all shapes and sizes, with the only commonality being the 1/4″-20 screw and threading.</p>

<p>So I tried to fix that by embedding a hex nut in the bottom of the mount so that any tripod could be used. Unfortunately, the only thing keeping the hex nut in there was a thin (1mm) piece of plastic that easily broke off under pressure. I should have thought of the torsional stresses of a long bar like the makerslide mounted on a tripod, but I didn’t have anything stronger at the time and just went with it.</p>

<p>Next, I tried using a large washer as the “strong” piece–by putting a hex nut <em>behind</em> the metal washer. I drilled two holes on either side of the 1/4″ hole of the washer to mount it to the makerslide. This worked well for strength, but my major oversight in this design was the need for two bolt heads to protrude from the washer. I could have put a specially designed spacer on top of the metal washer to make the surface flat, but then the threading of the hex nut would have been embedded 5mm or so <em>inside</em> the hole. Most tripod mount plates only have 3 or 4mm of bolt that protrudes, so that wasn’t an option.</p>

<p>I made a couple of early versions of the design now in use. Flimsy sides, too thin, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, the design you see pictures in the makerslide is the final robust result of all of this R&amp;D :) It would be even better if cast in metal, but it seems to be strong enough for what I need. The flanged nut is the key “innovation” in this design–since the flange will keep the threaded nut snug and secure in the plastic, the threading is exposed directly on the surface of the tripod mount piece (which is ideal). In addition, the bolts that secure the tripod mount to the makerslide are recessed and won’t touch the tripod’s base plate.</p>
